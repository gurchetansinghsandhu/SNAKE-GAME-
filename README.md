# SNAKE-GAME-
This project is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the pygame library. The game features smooth controls, a growing snake, increasing difficulty, and collision detection with walls and the snake's own body. Designed to be both nostalgic and fun, it's a great project to showcase game logic, real-time rendering.
